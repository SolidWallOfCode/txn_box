Buiding

|TxB| building is based on `SCons <https://scons.org>`__ and `Parts
<https://pypi.org/project/scons-parts/>`__. As a plugin, |TxB| also requires an instance of `Traffic
Server <https://trafficserver.apache.org>`__, or at least the plugin API header files.

Other dependencies

*  `pcre2 <https://www.pcre.org>`__

*  Scons/Parts::

      python3 -m pip install scons-parts

   It is important to use `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/>`__ - no attempt has been made for Python 2 compabitility.

To build the plugin, first build or install Traffic Server. Then use the command ::

   scons txn_box --with-trafficserver=<ts_path>

where ``<ts_path`` is the path to a Traffic Server install. In general this wil be the same
path as used for the ``prefix`` configuration option in Traffic Server.
